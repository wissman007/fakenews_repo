It is widely repeated that Winston Churchill once said, “You can always count on Americans to do the right thing — after they’ve tried everything else.” Although it’s not clear if Churchill ever did actually say that, it has become a popular quote and has provided countless laughs. But it’s not only Americans who struggle to do the right thing the first time, and it’s basically part of human nature that it can take us a long time to accept hard truths and deal with problems and challenges realistically — even more so when something significant has actually changed and gone from helpful to harmful. It’s no secret that Tesla sales have been half a world off of where they were supposed to be. A few years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla sales would grow at about 50% a year through the 2020s — not necessarily every year, but on average. That was happening for a bit, but things have not exactly been going according to plan for more than a year now. Far from seeing 50% sales growth in 2024, Tesla sales actually declined last year. This is in the context of the broader EV market growing. Growth was perhaps not as high as many expected, but EV sales were growing — just not Tesla’s. In the past year, Musk has gone from fairly politically neutral and detached to extremely politically involved — and often to a shocking degree. His extremist tendencies have dramatically upset millions of people in the US, the UK, Germany, France, and many, many other places. This has all led to significant sales hits, as well as protests at Tesla stores, Tesla owners putting bumper stickers on their cars to disassociate themselves from Elon Musk, and even illegal vandalism and violence that most of us would never support or condone. When you’re getting to the point of protests and bumper stickers, you know that there’s also got to be some degree of market response. In fact, Tesla sales are down much more in 2025 than they even were in 2024. Of course, the refreshed Tesla Model Y shook things up a bit — production lines had to be shut down and reworked, some buyers have been waiting on the new Model Y, etc., etc. But it seems highly unlikely that has caused as much of a dip in sales as we’ve seen, especially given all kinds of other evidence that Musk’s life at the White House, in DOGE offices, and often right beside or behind Donald Trump is hurting Tesla sales. Then there’s the almost constant tweeting (showing clear signs of sleep deprivation), preoccupation with other companies (Elon Musk’s X merging with Elon Musk’s xAI … SpaceX rockets exploding while others bring astronauts home), drama with the mama of his 11th (or 12th?) baby, numerous lawsuits, and the distracts just go on and on and on. Any reasonable and independent board of directors of a Fortune 500 company would have pulled the CEO into the board room a long time ago and said, “hey, you need to get focused on our company and improving these numbers or you’ve got to go.” (By the way, we just skipped past almost a decade of missed self-driving targets.) Well, the Tesla board of directors isn’t exactly reasonable and independent. Musk has been allowed to tarnish the Tesla brand (that he once was critical in building up) and drive sales down, down, down as the board has remained silent and seemingly useless. Until today…. News has broken that the Tesla board of directors has asked Elon Musk to step down from his role as CEO. (And just after he lost a Wisconsin Supreme Court battle he was for some reason sticking his nose and millions of dollars into.) Musk would still have a role in the company, but not running it and not being the main face of the company. It’s not clear yet who will step in as the new CEO, though. Stay tuned — we should have more info soon. That said, when the clock strikes midnight, the fairytale could be over, and we could be back where we started — exhausting all other options before going with the obvious one. *It’s now April 2, so for extra clarity (in case it wasn’t clear enough), note that the beautiful carriage turned back into a pumpkin at midnight. Though, somehow (which has never been clear to me), a glass slipper remains — so maybe the headline will be usable in the future after all. But not today.\', True), (\'1jqfkc7\', \'Hungary plans to withdraw from International Criminal Court\', \'https://nation.cymru/news/hungary-plans-to-withdraw-from-international-criminal-court/\', \'mrjohnnymac18\', \'Reddit\', \'Hungary plans to withdraw from International Criminal Court\', \'Hungary has said it will begin the procedure of withdrawing from the world’s only permanent global tribunal for war crimes and genocide. “Hungary will withdraw from the International Criminal Court,” Gergely Gulyas, who is Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s chief of staff wrote in a brief statement. “The government will initiate the withdrawal procedure on Thursday, in accordance with the constitutional and international legal framework.” Netanyahu visit The announcement came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, despite an international arrest warrant against him over his conduct of the war in the Gaza Strip. Hungary’s government, led by right-wing populist Mr Orban, extended the invitation to Mr Netanyahu in November after the ICC, based in the Hague, Netherlands, issued the warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity. Mr Orban, a close Netanyahu ally, has called the arrest warrant “outrageously impudent” and “cynical”.

The move drew swift criticism from major US trading partners, including China, Japan, Canada, Australia and the European Union, with several warning of retaliation. The White House said a 10% baseline tariff would take effect on Saturday, April 5, applying broadly to all countries. A second wave of duties will be implemented on April 9, targeting countries and regions that the administration says impose higher tariffs on US goods, enforce non-tariff barriers or undermine American economic interests. Among others, the regions and countries affected are the European Union (20% tariff), Vietnam (46%), Japan (24%), South Africa (30%), Cambodia (49%) and China (54%). Trump also confirmed that imported vehicles and foreign-made auto parts would face a 25% tariff. The measure, initally announced last week, is aimed at boosting domestic production while shielding US automakers from international competition — particularly China, the world’s largest car market. In January 2024, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned that Chinese automakers would “demolish” global competitors if trade barriers were removed. Musk said Chinese companies were the “most competitive” and “will have significant success outside of China, depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established.” Tesla shares were down 3.7% at $272 in Thursday premarket trading, after earlier losses pushed the stock as low as $260 following Trump’s announcement. China Tariffs China will face an effective tariff rate of 54% under the new measures, including existing levies already in place. Last year, tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles were quadrupled after President Joe Biden raised duties from 25% to 100% forcing EV makers to be able to sell in the U.S. only once they establish production plant and respective supply chain there. Back then, Biden’s administration also imposed a 25% tariff on lithium-ion EV batteries and a 50% duty on photovoltaic solar cells, with a 50% tariff on semiconductors from China expected to take effect later this year. In response to the latest escalation, China’s Ministry of Commerce on Thursday urged the US to “immediately cancel the unilateral tariff measures and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through equal dialogue.” “This approach disregards the balance of interests achieved through years of multilateral trade negotiations and ignores the fact that the U.S. has long reaped substantial benefits from international trade,” the ministry said in a statement. Mainland China’s CSI 300 Index slipped 0.59%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.52%. US-listed shares of Chinese EV makers also declined in premarket trading. Nio Inc. was down 2.9%, XPeng Inc. fell 1.3%, and Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding Ltd. dropped 0.3%. No Price Hike The tariff confirmation follows a Wall Street Journal report that Trump privately warned US automakers against raising prices in response to higher import duties. The report said company executives were left “rattled” and feared repercussions if they moved to pass costs on to consumers. Trump denied the claim last Saturday, telling NBC News: “No, I never said that.” He added, “I couldn’t care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars.” GM currently produces about 52% of its US-sold vehicles domestically, with 30% sourced from Canada and Mexico and 18% from other regions. Ford manufactures roughly 77% of its US vehicles at home, with 21% built in Canada and Mexico and 2% elsewhere. Trump said the tariffs would be permanent, adding, “The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we’re doing is being fair, and frankly, I’m being very generous.”\', True), (\'1jqe52q\', "Germany slams Trump tariffs as \'attack\' on international trade order", \'https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/germany-slams-trump-tariffs-as-attack-on-international-trade-order/3527096\', \'sweatycat\', \'Reddit\', \'cannot extract data\', \'cannot extract data\', False), (\'1jqe4eu\', \'Russia declares Elton John AIDS Foundation undesirable organisation\', \'https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/04/3/7505802/\', \'Creol6969\', \'Reddit\', \'Russia declares Elton John AIDS Foundation undesirable organisation\', \'Russia\\\'s Office of the Prosecutor General has declared the Elton John AIDS Foundation an "undesirable" organisation.

The conflict, initiated by Argentina’s military dictatorship, ended in British victory, with the islands remaining under UK control since 1833. Diplomatic and political divisions Milei reiterated Argentina’s “non-negotiable” claim over the islands and promised to exhaust all diplomatic resources to return them to Argentine hands. He also criticized past administrations, blaming their “corruption” for the failure to advance Argentina’s sovereignty claim. His speech, delivered at a ceremony in Plaza San Martín, was attended by key members of his government, including Security Minister Patricia Bullrich, Defense Minister Luis Petri, and Buenos Aires Mayor Jorge Macri. Veterans push back against Milei’s approach Juan Carlos Parodi, president of the Malvinas War Veterans’ Center in Ushuaia, rejected the idea that the islanders’ opinion should determine the islands’ sovereignty. “The President spoke of listening to the Falkland Islanders, something close to the principle of self-determination, but that does not apply here,” Parodi said, receiving applause from fellow veterans. “They are not an indigenous people, we all know that.” Parodi also questioned Milei’s ability to overturn decades of diplomatic setbacks, noting that the President has praised former leader Carlos Menem, who re-established relations with the UK in the 1990s through the controversial Madrid Agreements. Many veterans view these agreements as a betrayal of Argentina’s sovereignty claim. 47 years of dispute over the Falkland Islands The Falklands War, which began on Apr. 2, 1982, was launched by Argentina’s ruling military junta as an attempt to reclaim the islands. The UK, led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, responded with a military task force that defeated Argentina by Jun. 14, 1982. Since then, Argentina has maintained its claim, through the Falkland Islands’ 2013 referendum showed that 99.8% of islanders wish to remain a British Overseas Territory. The UK government insists that the islanders’ wishes must be respected, while Argentina argues that British control is colonial rule. Milei also signed a new decree, that recognizes former Malvinas reservists as official lieutenants, an act he described as “settling a debt with these heroes.” During the Malvinas War (1982), 649 Argentine soldiers died, 323 of them as a result of the sinking of the cruiser ARA General Belgrano caused by a British submarine.

Netanyahu’s visit to Hungary marked the first time the Israeli leader stepped foot on European soil since the ICC issued an arrest warrant against him in May 2024. The court said it had “reasonable grounds” to believe Netanyahu bears criminal responsibility for war crimes including “starvation as a method of warfare” and “the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.” The ICC doesn’t have its own law enforcement powers, so it relies on its member states to make arrests and transfer suspects to the Hague. As a signatory of the Rome Statute, which established the court in 2002, Hungary is obliged to arrest Netanyahu. But instead, Netanyahu got a warm welcome in the Hungarian capital where he is on a four-day visit. A welcoming ceremony at the Lion’s Court of the imposing Buda Castle saw him walk down a red carpet with Orban on Thursday, before the two leaders held talks. Hungary is one of Israel’s strongest European allies and many Hungarians hold a strong pro-Israel sentiment. Stickers and posters commemorating the victims of the October 7 terror attack against Israel are a common sign across Budapest.

Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images Hungary’s State Secretary for International Communication and Relations Zoltan Kovacs said the country will begin the withdrawal process on Thursday, “in line with Hungary’s constitutional and international legal obligations.” If it goes through with the withdrawal, Hungary will become the only European Union country not to be part of the ICC. The bloc has been split in its reaction to the arrest warrants. Some countries, like Ireland and Spain, said they would arrest Netanyahu if he was to visit their territory. Others, including France and Germany, gave a more cautious responses and questioned whether the ICC has jurisdiction over Israel as the country is not a member of the court. More than 120 countries have signed up to the Rome Statute, but there are some notable exceptions: the United States, China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are not members. Arrest warrant The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and the former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over the war in Gaza last May. The move marked the first time the ICC targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States, putting Netanyahu in the company of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant over Moscow’s war on Ukraine, and the Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, who was facing an arrest warrant from the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture and killing in October 2011. The US – under both the former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump – criticized the court for issuing the arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant. Trump went as far as taking steps against the court – imposing economic and travel sanctions on people working on ICC investigations into citizens of the US and its allies. At the same time, it also issued warrants for three top leaders of Hamas: its leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Al Qassem Brigades, the group’s armed wing Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader.

Netanyahu has condemned the ICC\\\'s decision as "antisemitic". Orban had invited Netanyahu as soon as the warrant was issued last November, saying the ruling would have "no effect" in his country. The move was announced by a senior official in Prime Minister Viktor Orban\\\'s government hours after Israel\\\'s leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who is sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in Hungary for a state visit. Hungary\\\'s government has announced it is withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC, a global court, has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Hungary is a founding member of the ICC, which counts 125 member states, and will be the first European Union nation to pull out of it. A withdrawal has no impact on on-going proceedings. The ICC was a "respectable initiative", Orban\\\'s chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told Hungarian state-owned news agency MTI, but added it had deviated from its original purpose and become a political body. He said the warrant issued against Netanyahu was unacceptable and that the government did not want to participate in the court\\\'s work anymore. Hungary\\\'s parliament has never proclaimed the ICC\\\'s statute, so it is not part of the country\\\'s law, Gulyas added. Israel meanwhile has thanked Orban for its "clear and strong moral stance alongside Israel," Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\\\'ar wrote on X. "The so-called \\\'International Criminal Court\\\' lost its moral authority after trampling the fundamental principles of international law in its zest for harming Israel\\\'s right to self-defence," Sa\\\'ar added. Hungary\\\'s decision aligns with its broader foreign policy stance under Orban, who has cultivated close ties with Israel and adopted a critical view of international institutions perceived as infringing on national sovereignty. While Hungary\\\'s withdrawal may carry symbolic weight and political implications, it does not significantly alter the ICC\\\'s operational capacity or legal framework. The court has faced similar challenges in the past and continues to function with broad international support. But Hungary\\\'s criticism of the ICC as "politically biased" and its decision to withdraw as Netanyahu visits may set a precedent for other nations to question or abandon their commitments to international justice based on political alliances or disagreements with specific rulings. The US, Russia, China and North Korea are among the nations that are not part of the ICC, and therefore do not recognise its jurisdiction. Israel is also not part of the treaty, but the ICC ruled in 2021 that it did have jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, because the UN\\\'s Secretary General had accepted that Palestinians were a member. Hungary now needs to send written notification to the UN Secretary General to leave the treaty, with the withdrawal taking effect one year later, according to article 127 of the Rome Statute. ICC spokesman Fad El-Abdullah told the BBC: "On the visit of Mr Netanyahu, the Court has followed its standard procedures, after the issuance of an arrest warrant. The Court recalls that Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the ICC." Since the warrant was issued, Hungarian authorities should technically arrest Netanyahu and hand him over to the court in the Hague, although member states do not always choose to enforce ICC warrants. In Europe, some ICC member states said they would arrest the Israeli leader if he set foot in their country, while others, such as Germany, announced that he would not be detained if he visited. The White House had said the US rejected the ICC decision and Netanyahu has visited the country since the warrant was issued in November. His visit to Hungary marks Netanyahu\\\'s first trip to Europe since then.

President Donald Trump had imposed 20% tariffs on the bloc on Wednesday. Speaking on a livestreamed broadcast, von der Leyen said that Trump’s move was a “major blow” to the world economy. “There seems to be no order in the disorder, no clear path to the complexity and chaos that is being created as all U.S. trading partners are hit,” she said. “Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism, [and] the consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe, also for the most vulnerable countries, which are now subject to some of the highest U.S. tariffs.” Von der Leyen said she agreed with Trump that some countries were taking unfair advantage of the current rules in world trade and that the E.U. was ready to support efforts to make the global trading system “fit for the realities of the global economy.” However, she also warned the U.S. that “reaching for tariffs as your first and last tool will not fix it.” The bloc had previously announced retaliatory duties after the U.S. imposed tariffs last month in a bid to protect European workers and consumers. The E.U. said at the time that it would introduce counter-tariffs on 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods. Previously suspended duties — which were at least partially in place during Trump’s first term as president — are set to be reintroduced alongside a slew of additional duties on further goods. Industrial-grade steel and aluminum and other steel and aluminum semi-finished and finished products, along with their derivative commercial products such as machinery parts and knitting needles, were set to be included.

Last year, it was the largest single market for US goods exports, ahead of America’s neighbors Canada and Mexico, based on figures from the United States Census Bureau. “President Trump’s announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world including the European Union is a major blow to the world economy. I deeply regret this choice,” Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Union’s executive arm, said on Thursday, adding the tariffs will be felt “immediately.” Trump on Wednesday launched a historic global trade war, announcing sweeping global tariffs on dozens of nations, from Nicaragua to Cambodia. The tariffs come on top of previously imposed taxes on imports of steel, aluminum and cars. “Let’s be clear-eyed about the immense consequences. The global economy will massively suffer. Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism,” von der Leyen said in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, where she is attending the EU-Central Asia Summit. “All businesses, big and small, will suffer from day 1, from big uncertainty to the disruption of supply chains, to burdensome bureaucracy. The costs of doing business with the United States will drastically increase,” she said. While the European Union would prefer to work with the US to reduce trade barriers, von der Leyen said “Europe is ready to respond.” “We are already finalizing the first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel, and we are now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail,” she added. Last month, the EU responded to Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs by unveiling countermeasures on up to 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of exports of American goods, including tariffs on boats, bourbon and motorbikes. Both Europe and the US have a lot at stake in the escalating trade dispute. In 2024, America was the biggest buyer of European goods, with imports ranging from pharmaceutical products and cars to alcoholic drinks and telecommunications equipment, according to official EU data. The EU, meanwhile, was America’s biggest source of goods imports last year, the US figures showed. “In the past 80 years trade between the European Union and the United States has created millions of jobs,” von der Leyen said on Thursday. “Consumers across the Atlantic have benefitted from reduced prices. Businesses have benefitted from huge opportunities, leading to unprecedented growth and prosperity.” Still, she said the global trading system has “serious deficiencies.” “I agree with President Trump that others are taking unfair advantage of the current rules and I am ready to support any efforts to make the global trading system fit for the realities of the global economy,” von der Leyen said. “Reaching for tariffs as your first and last tool will not fix it.” She stressed that the European Union is ready to negotiate with the US, but Europe must stand up for itself. “I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally. Yes, we must brace for the impact that this will inevitably have. Europe has everything it needs to make it through the storm. We are in this together. If you take on one of us, you take on all of us.”\', True), (\'1jqbahu\', "Russia, Belarus excluded from Trump\'s sweeping tariffs list due to existing sanctions, White House says", \'https://kyivindependent.com/russia-missing-from-trumps-sweeping-tariffs-list-as-its-already-sanctioned-white-house-confirms/\', \'MothersMiIk\', \'Reddit\', "Russia, Belarus excluded from Trump\'s sweeping tariffs due to existing sanctions, White House says", \'This audio is created with AI assistance The U.S. did not include Russia on its "Liberation Day" tariff list as the existing sanctions "preclude any meaningful trade," Axios reported on April 3, citing White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a sweeping list of "reciprocial tariffs" on April 2, imposing a baseline 10% duty on all countries — including Ukraine — with even higher rates for major trade partners like the EU. Russia and Belarus were not included on the list, according to the White House charts. Talking to Axios, Leavitt said that Russia and Belarus were left off the list because of the already imposed economic sanctions. The news outlet nevertheless noted that even countries with a smaller traded volume with the U.S., such as Mauritius and Brunei, were included. The spokesperson added that other heavily sanctioned countries, such as Cuba and North Korea, were also left out of the list. The U.S. and other nations imposed heavy sanctions against Moscow after the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. U.S.-Russia trade flows went from $36 billion in 2021 to about $3.5 billion in 2024. Trump previously hinted at the possibility of easing some of the sanctions imposed on Russia as part of an effort to broker a ceasefire and a peace deal in Ukraine. At the same time, the U.S. president threatened Moscow with secondary tariffs on Russian oil exports as he grows frustrated with stalled negotiations. The new tariffs were described by the media as a "historic global trade war," with the Trump administration presenting it as a step toward restoring economic sovereignty and security. Some 60 countries or trading blocs were hit with additional duties higher than the 10% baseline, including the EU (20%), China (34%), and Taiwan (32%). Canada and Mexico were among those excluded due to the already existing 25% tariff.

Amazon announced Project Kuiper in 2019, with plans to invest $10 billion into the network’s development, after hiring a team of engineers who had been leading Musk’s Starlink before he fired them the prior year. Since then, SpaceX has swiftly launched about 8,000 Starlink satellites in space and amassed over five million internet users across 125 countries, upending the global satellite communications market and wooing militaries and intelligence agencies that have sought to use Starlink for secure communications.
